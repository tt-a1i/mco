# v0.1.1 - Generalized Agent Execution Baseline

Date: 2026-02-26

## Highlights

`v0.1.1` extends the project from review-only orchestration to an agent-callable generalized execution layer:

- Added `mco run` command for generic multi-provider execution.
- Kept `mco review` as review-specialized mode with strict findings contract and decisioning.
- Added policy-level path and permission controls:
  - `allow_paths`
  - `provider_permissions`
  - `enforcement_mode` (`strict` or `best_effort`)
- Added provider-specific permission capability handling (`claude`, `codex`).
- Added runtime and CLI tests covering run-mode behavior, path escape rejection, and strict fail-closed permission enforcement.

## Command Examples

Review mode:

```bash
./mco review \
  --repo . \
  --prompt "Review for high-risk bugs and security issues." \
  --providers claude,codex \
  --json
```

General run mode:

```bash
./mco run \
  --repo . \
  --prompt "Summarize architecture tradeoffs in this repository." \
  --providers claude,codex,gemini \
  --allow-paths runtime,scripts \
  --target-paths runtime \
  --enforcement-mode strict \
  --json
```

## Security and Permission Boundary

- `allow_paths` and `target_paths` are validated against `repo_root`; path escape is rejected.
- In `strict` mode, unsupported provider permission keys fail closed.
- In `best_effort` mode, unsupported permission keys are dropped with warning-style metadata.
- OS-level sandboxing still depends on provider capabilities; policy validation alone is not a full kernel-level sandbox.

## Verification

- Unit tests: `62` passed.
- Runtime gate: `PASS` (`Runtime G/H status: PASS`).
- Step5 benchmark baseline remains available under `reports/adapter-contract/2026-02-26/`.
